=head1 NAME

B<copycds> - Copies Linux distributions and service levels from CDs/DVDs to install directory.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<copycds> [{B<-n|--name|--osver>}=I<distroname>] [{B<-a|--arch>}=I<architecture>] [{B<-p|--path>}=I<ospkgpath>] {I<iso>|I<device-path>} ...

B<copycds> [B<-i>|B<--inspection>] {I<iso>|I<device-path>}

B<copycds> [B<-h>|B<--help>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<copycds> command copies all contents of Distribution CDs/DVDs or Service Pack CDs/DVDs to a destination directory. The destination directory is specified by -p option. If no path is specified, the default destination directory will be formed from the B<installdir> site attribute and the distro name and architecture, for example: /install/sles11.2/ppc64. The B<copycds> command can copy from one or more ISO files, or CD/DVD device path. You can specify -i or --inspection option to check whether the CDs/DVDs can be recognized by xCAT. If recognized, the distribution name, architecture and the disc no (the disc sequence number of CDs/DVDs in multi-disk distribution) of the CD/DVD is displayed. If xCAT doesn't recognize the CD/DVD, you must specify the -n and -a options. This is sometimes the case for distros that have very recently been released, and the xCAT code hasn't been updated for it yet.



=head1 OPTIONS

=over 6

=item {B<-n|--name|--osver>}=I<distroname>

The linux distro name and version that the ISO/DVD contains.  Examples:  rhels5.3, centos5.1, fedora9.

=item {B<-a|--arch>}=I<architecture>

The architecture of the linux distro on the ISO/DVD.  Examples:  x86, x86_64, ppc64.

=item {B<-p|--path>}=I<ospkgpath>

The destination directory to which the contents of ISO/DVD will be copied. When this option is not specified, the default destination directory will be formed from the B<installdir> site attribute and the distro name and architecture, for example: /install/sles11.2/ppc64. This option only supports distributions of sles and redhat.

=item {B<-i|--inspection>}

Check whether xCAT can recognize the CD/DVDs in the argument list without any disc copy, display the os distribution name, architecture and disc no of each recognized CD/DVD. This option only supports distributions of sles and redhat.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 2

=item *

To copy the RPMs from a set of ISOs that represent the CDs of a distro:

B<copycds cd1.iso cd2.iso cd3.iso>

=item *

To copy the RPMs from a physical DVD to /depot/kits/3 directory:

B<copycds -p /depot/kits/3 /dev/dvd>

=item *

To copy the RPMs from a DVD ISO of a very recently released distro:

B<copycds -n rhels5.3 -a x86_64 dvd.iso>

=item *

To check whether a DVD ISO can be recognized by xCAT and display the recognized disc info:

B<copycds -i /media/RHEL/6.0/RHEL6.0-20100922.1-Server-ppc64-DVD1.iso>

=back

=head1 NOTES

1. The B<-p> and B<-i> options currently only support distributions of sles and redhat.

2. The output format of copycds --inspection is:

  OS Image:<value>
  DISTNAME:<value>
  ARCH:<value>
  DISCNO:<value>

As a example:

  OS Image:/media/RHEL/6.2/RHEL6.2-20111117.0-Server-ppc64-DVD1.iso
  DISTNAME:rhels6.2
  ARCH:ppc64
  DISCNO:1

For the attributes failed to be recognized, the value will be blank.
