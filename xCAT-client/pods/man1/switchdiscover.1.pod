=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<switchdiscover [-h| --help]>

I<switchdiscover [-v| --version]>


I<switchdiscover [noderange] [-V] [-i adpt[,adpt..]][-w][-r|-x|-z][-n][-s scan_methods]>



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The switchdiscover command scan the subnets and discover all the swithches on the subnets.  The default subnets will be the ones that the xCAT management node is on. The command will also take a subnet as an input. The default discovery method will be lldpd. The nmap and snmp methods will be supported as options chosen by -s option. The optional -r -x and -z format the output.


=head1 OPTIONS

B<noderange>   The switches which the user want to discover.
            If the user specify the noderange, switchdiscover will just return the switches 
            in the node range. Which means it will help to add the new switches to the xCAT
            database without modifying the existed definitions. But the switches' name 
            specified in noderange should be defined in database in advance. The ips of the
            switches will be defined in /etc/hosts file. This command will fill the switch 
            attributes for the switches defined. 

B<-i>          adapter(s) the command will search through (defaults to all available adapters).

B<-h>          Display usage message.

B<-n>          Only display and write the newly discovered switches.

B<--range>     Specify one or more IP ranges.  
            It accepts multiple formats. For example, 192.168.1.1/24, 40-41.1-2.3-4.1-100.
            If the range is huge, for example, 192.168.1.1/8, lsslp may take a very long 
            time for node scan. So the range should be exactly specified. 

B<-r>          Display Raw response.

B<-s>          It is a comma separated list of methods for switch discovery. 
            The possible switch scan methods are: llpd, nmap and snmp. The default is lldpd.

B<-v>          Command Version.

B<-V>          Verbose output.

B<-w>          Writes output to xCAT database.

B<-x>          XML format.

B<-z>          Stanza formated output.
