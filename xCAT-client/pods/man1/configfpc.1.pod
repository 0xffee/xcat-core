=head1 NAME

B<configfpc> - discover the Fan Power Controllers (FPCs) and configure the FPC interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<configfpc> B<-i> I<interface>

B<configfpc> [B<-V>|B<--verbose>] 

B<configfpc> [B<-h>|B<--help>|B<-?>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<configfpc> will discover and configure all FPCs that are set to the default IP address.

The B<-i> B<interface> is required to direct B<configfpc> to the xCAT MN interface which is on the same VLAN as the FPCs.

There are several bits of information that must be included in the xCAT database before running this command.

You must create the FPC node definitions for all FPCs being discovered including the IP address and switch port information.

The B<configfpc> command discovers the FPCs and collects the MAC address. The MAC address is used to relate the FPC to a FPC node using the switch information for this MAC. Once the relationship is discovered the FPC is configured with the FPC node IP settings. 

This process is repeated until no more FPCs are discovered. 

For more information on xCAT support of NeXtScale and configfpc see:
XCAT_NeXtScale_Clusters

=head1 OPTIONS
