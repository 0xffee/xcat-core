B<makentp> - Setup NTP server on the management node and the service node.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<switchdiscover [-h|--help]>

I<switchdiscover [-v|--version]>


I<switchdiscover [-a|--all] [-V|--verbose]>



=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<makentp> command sets up the NTP server on the xCAT management node and the service node.

By default, it sets up the NTP server for xCAT management node. It gets the site table attribute I<extntpservers> and have the local NTP server sync with the external ntp servers defined by <site.extntpservers>. If -a flag is specified, the command also works for all the service nodes that have I<servicenode.ntpserver> set. The NTP server on the service node will sync with the management node. 

This command is also called by xcatd when it starts on the xCAT management node and the service nodes. 

To setup NTP client on other nodes such as compute nodes, please add B<setupntp> postscript to the I<postscripts> table and run I<updatenode node -P setupntp>. The setupntp postscripts honors I<site.ntpservers> attribute for NTP servers. If the value of I<site.ntpservers> is "<xcatmaster>" then the management node or the service node that serves the node will be the NTP server.
