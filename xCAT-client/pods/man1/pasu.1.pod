B<pasu> [B<-h> | B<--help>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<pasu> command runs the ASU command in out-of-band mode in parallel to multiple nodes.  Out-of-band mode means
that ASU connects from the xCAT management node to the IMM (BMC) of each node to set or query the ASU settings.  To
see all of the ASU settings available on the node, use the "show all" command.  To query or set multiple values,
use the B<-b> (batch) option.  To group similar output from multiple nodes, use L<xcoll(1)|xcoll.1>.

Current Limitation:  The pasu command currently only queries the node names from the xCAT DB, but ASU really
needs to connect to the IMM of the node.  You can make this work by defining hostnames for your IMMs that are of
the form:  <nodename>-imm .  Then use the B<-i imm> flag and pasu will add "-imm" to each nodename before contacting
it.  Or you can use the B<-n> option and give the list of IMM hostnames or IP addresses explicitly.

Before running B<pasu>, you must install the ASU RPM from IBM.  You can download it from the IBM Fix Central site.
You also must configure the IMMs properly according to xCAT documentation.  Run "B<rpower> I<noderange> B<stat>"
to confirm that the IMMs are configured properly.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 10

=item B<-i|--interface> I<suffix>

A suffix to add to each nodename before connecting to it.  Currently use this to change the nodename into the
IMM name.

=item B<-n|--nonodecheck>

Do not send the noderange to xcatd to expand it into a list of nodes.  Use the noderange exactly as it is specified
to pasu.  In this case, the noderange must be a simple list of comma-separated node names.

=item B<-l|--loginname> I<username>

The username to use to connect to the IMMs.  If not specified, the row in the xCAT B<passwd> table with key "ipmi"
will be used to get the username.  Currently B<pasu> does not use the table value ipmi.username.

=item B<-p|--passwd> I<passwd>

The password to use to connect to the IMMs.  If not specified, the row in the xCAT passwd table with key "ipmi"
will be used to get the password.  Currently B<pasu> does not use the table value ipmi.password.

=item B<-f|--fanout>

How many processes to run in parallel simultaneously.  The default is 64.  You can also set the XCATPSHFANOUT
environment variable.

=item B<-b|--batch> -I<batchfile>

A simple text file that contains multiple ASU commands, each on its own line.

=item B<-d|--donotfilter>

By default, pasu filters out (i.e. does not display) the standard initial output from ASU:

 IBM Advanced Settings Utility version 9.30.79N
 Licensed Materials - Property of IBM
 (C) Copyright IBM Corp. 2007-2012 All Rights Reserved
 Connected to IMM at IP address node2-imm

If you want this output to be displayed, use this flag.

=item B<-V|--verbose>

Display verbose messages.

=item B<-h|--help>

Display usage message.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

0  The command completed successfully.

1  An error has occurred.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over 3

=item 1.

To display the Com1ActiveAfterBoot setting on 2 nodes:

 pasu -n node1,node2 show DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot

Output is similar to:

   node1: DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot=Enable
   node2: DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot=Enable

=item 2.

To display the Com1ActiveAfterBoot setting on all compute nodes (and the IMMs have hostnames like <node>-imm):

 pasu -i imm compute show DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot | xcoll

Output is similar to:

   ====================================
   compute
   ====================================
   DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot=Enable

=item 3.

To set several settings on all compute nodes (and the IMMs have hostnames like <node>-imm), create a batch file
called (for example) asu-settings with contents:

 set DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot Enable
 set DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortSharing Enable
 set DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortAccessMode Dedicated
 set DevicesandIOPorts.RemoteConsole Enable

Then run:

 pasu -i imm -b asu-settings compute | xcoll

Output is similar to:

   ====================================
   compute
   ====================================
   Batch mode start.
   [set DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot Enable]
   DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot=Enable

   [set DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortSharing Enable]
   DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortSharing=Enable

   [set DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortAccessMode Dedicated]
   DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortAccessMode=Dedicated

   [set DevicesandIOPorts.RemoteConsole Enable]
   DevicesandIOPorts.RemoteConsole=Enable

   Beginning intermediate batch update.
   Waiting for command completion status.
   Command completed successfully.
   Completed intermediate batch update.
   Batch mode competed successfully.

=item 4.

To confirm that all the settings were made on all compute nodes, create a batch file
called (for example) asu-show with contents:

 show DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot
 show DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortSharing
 show DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortAccessMode
 show DevicesandIOPorts.RemoteConsole

Then run:

 pasu -i imm -b asu-show compute | xcoll

Output is similar to:

   ====================================
   compute
   ====================================
   Batch mode start.
   [show DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot]
   DevicesandIOPorts.Com1ActiveAfterBoot=Enable

   [show DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortSharing]
   DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortSharing=Enable

   [show DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortAccessMode]
   DevicesandIOPorts.SerialPortAccessMode=Dedicated

   [show DevicesandIOPorts.RemoteConsole]
   DevicesandIOPorts.RemoteConsole=Enable

   Batch mode competed successfully.
