=head1 EXAMPLES

1. To check if a kit component is fitting to an osimage

chkkitcomp -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64

Output is similar to:

Kit components comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 fit to osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute

3. To check if a kit component is fitting to an osimage and write the current kitcompname_list specified in command line to osimage.kitcomponents attribute. 

chkkitcomp -o -i rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64

Output is similar to:

kitcomponents comp-test1-1.0-1-rhels-6.2-ppc64 were removed from osimage rhels6.2-ppc64-netboot-compute successfully
