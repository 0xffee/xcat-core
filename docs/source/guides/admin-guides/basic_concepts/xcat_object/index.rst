xCAT Objects Types
==================

xCAT abstracts several types of objects from the cluster information in xCAT database to represent the physical or logical entities in the cluster. Each xCAT object has a set of attributes, each attribute is mapped from a specified field of a xCAT table. The xCAT users can get cluster information and perform cluster management work through operations against the objects. 

This section presents a brief introduction on xCAT objects, including some basic object types and xCAT commands on objects.
