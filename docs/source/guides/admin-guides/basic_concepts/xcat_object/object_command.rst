Object Commands
===============

There are 4 commands in xCAT to manage the objects:

* ``mkdef`` : create object definitions
* ``chdef`` : modify object definitions
* ``lsdef`` : list object definitions
* ``rmdef`` : remove object definitions 


For details on these commands, please refer to [TODO the manpage] or run ``man <command>``.
