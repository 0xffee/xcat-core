Basic Concepts
==============

Most xCAT data, including global configuration and cluster information, are stored in xCAT tables in the databse. xCAT abstracts serveral object types from the cluster information to perform the cluster management work. 

This section presents some basic xCAT knowledge, including xCAT global configuration, the description of xCAT object types and database tables, some commands and techniques on xCAT objects and databse tables, the network services used in xCAT and the typical network planning for a xCAT managed cluster.
