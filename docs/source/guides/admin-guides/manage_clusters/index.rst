===============

This chapter introduces the procedures of how to manage a real cluster. Basically, it includes the following parts:

  * Discover and Define Nodes
  * Deploy/Configure OS for the Nodes
  * Install/Configure Applications for the Nodes
  * General System Management Work for the Nodes

You should select the proper sub-chapter according to the hardware type of your cluster. If having a mixed cluster that has multiple types of hardware, you have to refer to multiple sub-chapters accordingly.
