Introduction
============

In supporting large clusters, it is desirable to have more than a single management node handling the installation and management of compute nodes.  

In xCAT, these additional nodes are referred to as *Service Nodes (SN)*.  The management node can delegate all management operations for a compute node to the Service node that is managing them.  You can have one of more service nodes configured to install and manage a group of compute nodes.
