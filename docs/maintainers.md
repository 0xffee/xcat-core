# xCAT Project Maintainers Guide


The roles and responsibilities of the maintainers are:

  * set the direction for the xCAT project, including architectural and design decisions
  * commit code (new function or fixes) to the xCAT Git repository (either their own code, or on behalf of another contributor - see below)
  * review requests for xCAT contributors to become maintainers (All such requests will be subject to a vote by current maintainers)
  * review and help resolve technical concerns or problems regarding the project

All decisions by the maintainers are made by consensus.

When a **maintainer** merges a pull request for a **contributor** they must:

  * Require that each code contributor complete and sign the [xCAT Individual CLA](./xcat-cla-individual.md) or [xCAT Corporate CLA](./xcat-ccla-corporate.md) and email a PDF copy to xcat-legal@lists.sourceforge.net .
  * Require that all code be contributed under the EPL.
